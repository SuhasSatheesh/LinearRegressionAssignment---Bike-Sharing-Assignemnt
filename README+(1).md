## General Information
- A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

## Business Objective
- The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Objective of the Assignment
- Creating a linear model that describe the effect of various features on demand.
- The model should be interpretable so that the management can understand it.
